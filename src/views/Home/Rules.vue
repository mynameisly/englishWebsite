        6 order-receiving rooms, in which the goods promotion will bring

        user needs to meet the room unlocking requirements. The user can receive
        orders for 60 times per day per account. That is to say, the user has
        the opportunity to earn the commission for 60 times. If the user
        successfully receives the orders for 60 times, the system will
        automatically set the upper limit. The invitation code will be generated
        for each user after registration. The user can register as new user
        through scanning the invitation code shared by the agent, and become the
        fist-level agent member of the team. The new users registered through
        scanning the invitation code of the first-level agent will become such
        userâ€™s second-level agent. In a same fashion, the new users registered
        through scanning the invitation code of the second-level agent will
        become the team third-level agent.
